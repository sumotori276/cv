# cv

This repository hosts my personal CV site on GitHub Pages.

- Site: https://katsunari-yamashita.github.io/cv/
- Theme: GitHub Pages “minimal” (jekyll-theme-minimal)
- Main contents: current positions, short biography, publications, and links (Google Scholar, ORCID).

I mainly use this repository to update my online CV.
